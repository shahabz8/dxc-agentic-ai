r"""agent.py  --  the AskIT agent. This is the ONLY file you edit in Lab 5.

FIRST: in VS Code click  File > Open Folder  and open this folder:
    C:\AskIT\dxc-agentic-ai\Day05\Labs\lab05-askit-agent-loop

WHERE YOU EDIT  (press Ctrl+F and search for the word shown):
    Lab 5A    nothing to write. Read 3 small functions, then run run_5a.py
    Lab 5B    TODO-1   write the agent loop                      (search:  TODO-1)
    Lab 5C    TODO-2   say which tools need a human's approval   (search:  TODO-2)
    Incident  change one word, False to True                     (search:  STOP_ON_REPEAT)

Everything else is already built. Parts marked  READ ONLY  are for you to read, not to change.
Stuck? Open  Day05\Hints\lab05_hints.md . Every TODO there has a full answer you can copy.

The messages to the AI model use the AWS Bedrock "Converse" format. You will see these three shapes:
    the user says something :  {"role": "user",      "content": [ {"text": "What is ticket TKT-0004?"} ]}
    the model wants a tool  :  {"role": "assistant", "content": [ {"toolUse": {"toolUseId": "a1", "name": "get_ticket", "input": {"ticket_id": "TKT-0004"}}} ]}
    we give the tool result :  {"role": "user",      "content": [ {"toolResult": {"toolUseId": "a1", "content": [ {"json": {...}} ]}} ]}
